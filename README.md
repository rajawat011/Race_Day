# Project Title

> One-line summary of what this project does and who it's for.
this project is for a annual race. I'm gonna write a program for runners registeration to give them time and instruction on race day acording to their age and registration timeing.

## Overview
- **Problem:** What user problem are we solving?

.manage timeing for different age group participants
.assign runners their particular race number therefore raceing track

- **Outcome:** What does success look like for a user?

. if early adult get race no. above 1000 and late below 1000 and race time 9:30 am and 11:30am respectively

. and youth registrants race time at 12:30 pm


- **MVP (v1.0):** Smallest set of features to prove value.
- **Stretch (v1.1+):** Nice-to-haves after MVP.

## User Stories (examples)

- As a [organizer of annual race ], I want [to assign race number to participants as per their age and registration timeing], so that [every runner get their race no. therefore their particular race track and to fare competition between adults and young runners ].

- …(add 5–10 stories)

## Acceptance Criteria (for MVP)
- [ ] When I…, then…, and…
- [ ] …

 - Given <race number>, when <adult register early>, then <their race number should be start at or above 1000 and run at 9: 30 am>.

- Given <race number>, when <adult register late>, then <their race number should be below 1000 and run at 11:00 am>.

- Given <race number regardless of registration time>, when <Youth registered>, then <their race start at 12: 30 pm>.

## Non‑Goals (explicitly out of scope for now)
- …

## Tech Stack

```
If you add tooling later (Node, Python, etc.), document the exact setup here.
