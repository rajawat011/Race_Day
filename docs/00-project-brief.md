# 00 â€“ Project Brief

this project is for a annual race. I'm gonna write a program for runners registeration to give them time and instruction on race day.

## 1) Problem Statement
Who has the problem? What hurts?

the organizer of annual race has problem in manageing the event, assign race numbers to participants and to schedule the timeing of runners acording to their age, and registration time.

## 2) Audience / Users
Who will use it? Any constraints?

the participants of annual race.

## 3) Value Proposition
Why is this worth building? What is the simplest thing that proves value?

. to easily identify the runner's age by their race no.
. to assign them valid timeline.


## 4) MVP Scope
List the minimum features needed for a useful demo.

. assign a race no to every runner
. assign  at or above 1000 race no. to early adult runners 
. below 1000 to late adult runners. 

## 5) Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)
Nice-to-haves later.

. UI design of this script.

## 6) Risks & Assumptions
What could block us? What are we assuming is true?

. in makeing variables to define their race no. according their age and registration time

## 7) Success Metrics
How will we know it worked? (e.g., user completes X, page loads < 2s, etc.)

. if every runner get the correct time line i mentioned earlier
